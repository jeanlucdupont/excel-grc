The Excel sheet comes with a sample risk assessment. Once you read the sample risk assessment, you understand how it works.
All the inputs are done in the "assessment" tab. For each risk, provide:
- A risk id (any text)
- The impacted asset
- A scenario (something bad could happen to this asset)
- Consequences if the scenario actually happens
- You CIA evaluation.
